# Warframe
Update 1.6

Mad's Melee Macro's
-------------------
Set a Hotkey And Customize your Attack Speed.
Easy to bind a button for customized attack speeds in warframe.
Switch your Attack speed While playing To find that good melee speed! With +- "if you have set the hotkeys"
Then Save it with a Custom Name and your Attack Speed.

Important! 
If you use to fast Attack Speed You will Attack Slower! 
Try find the fastest Attack speed for your current mods/weapon
Example Speed 1 = slower than speed 200 even tho the button is spammed faster.
You want to try get the Fastest speed u can without making the game Block it.
If the game Block it because its too fast then Warframe sets its own speed and makes it slow.
The ingame Attacks per seconds dont count Base/mods/buffs Attack speed.
